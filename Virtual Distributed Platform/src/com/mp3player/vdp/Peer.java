/**
 * A virtual distributed network ({@link VDP}) consists of equals
 * <code>Peer</code>s.
 * <p>
 * Each peer has a public name and address which can be obtained using
 * {@link #getName()} and {@link #getAddress()}, respectively. These are not
 * used to uniquely identify the peer but rather to serve as information to
 * display to the user.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The local machine is also represented as a peer and can be obtained through
 * {@link VDP#getLocalPeer()}. Use {@link Peer#isLocal()} to check for the local
 * peer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Peers can mount local files to make them accessible to other peers using one
 * of {@link VDP}'s mount methods. To access a remotely mounted file, call
 * {@link #getFile(String)} or {@link #getRootFiles()} of that
 * <code>Peer</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sending a message to a peer can be achieved with {@link #send(Serializable)}.
