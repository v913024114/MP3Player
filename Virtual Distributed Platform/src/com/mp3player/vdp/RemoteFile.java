 * Local files can be mounted using one of {@link VDP}'s mount methods. To
 * access a remote file, use {@link Peer#getRootFiles()} or

 * Mounted directories indirectly mount all contained files and folders. The

 * directory, see {@link #getPath()}.
 * </p>

 * <p>
 * Once mounted, files should not be changed until unmounted. However, the
 * contents of directories are allowed to change.
