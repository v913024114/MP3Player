/**
 * All objects that are shared among clients extend <code>Distributed</code>.
 * <p>
 * Each distributed object has a unique ID which must be provided in the
 * constructor. If multiple objects with the same ID are detected
 * {@link #resolveConflict(Conflict)} is called to determine which one will be
 * kept. The other instance is then discarded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a distributed object is changed locally, it must call
 * {@link #fireChangedLocally()} which triggers the synchronization process.
 * After each change (by the local peer or a connected peer) all
 * <code>changeListeners</code> receive a {@link DataChangeEvent}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The synchronization is implemented using serialization to transfer the data
 * and reflection to copy the data to the local object. This procedure ensures
 * that any references to the shared object stay valid after synchronization.
 * </p>
