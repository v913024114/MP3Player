Installing instructions for Tritonus, version 0.2.0

What you need
=============

- jdk1.2.x or jdk1.1.x for Linux. Testing was done with the Blackdown
jdk1.2.2 RC3, jdk1.1.7 v3 and jdk1.1.8 v1 (http://www.blackdown.org/). Other
versions may work.  If you want to use jdk1.1.x you need the 1.1
collections framework (it's an additional jar file) from
http://web2.java.sun.com/beans/infobus/ (look down the page).

- the Enlightened Sound Daemon (esd or EsounD). On Debian systems,
install the packages esound-common, esound, libesd0 and
libesd0-dev. On Suse systems, install the package esound. If esd is
not part of your Linux distribution, look at www.gnome.org. Make sure
you have not only the daemon and the library, but also the header
files for libesd.

- If you want to use the MIDI stuff: the ALSA drivers (& library)
version 0.5.1a or later (most recent version recommended). See
http://www.alsa-project.org/.


Installing steps
================

1. Unpack the distribution. It should unpack into a directory
tritonus-<version>. cd into the top-level directory.

2. Issue 'configure' ('./configure' if you build as root) in the
top-level directory.

3. Issue 'make' or 'make compileinitial' (the second one is
faster). There are spurious compilation errors with some jdk1.1
versions. Just restart with 'make' (even if you originally said 'make
compileinitial') and they will go away. This may be necessary several
times.

4. Issue 'make install'. This will copy the files tritonus.jar,
javalayer.jar, libesdtritonus.so.1.0 and libtritonusalsa.so.1.0 into
the directory tree of the jdk, thereby installing it as an
extension. Note that this works only if you have a jdk/jre1.2 or
higher and java is accessible in the path. If you have jdk/jre1.1.x,
you have to set the CLASSPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the above
files. The important files are:

- tritonus-x.y.z/tritonus.jar - this contains the java classes and
should be in your CLASSPATH

- tritonus-x.y.z/javalayer.jar - this contains the java classes for the mp3 decoder (seperated because of legal reasons). They should be in your CLASSPATH, too.

-  tritonus-x.y.z/src/lib/alsa/libtritonusalsa.so.1.0 (if you use the MIDI stuff)

-  tritonus-x.y.z/src/lib/esd/libesdtritonus.so.1.0

this contains the native 
code and should be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you found bugs, have suggestions, want to contribute or whatever,
you can contact the author of this library:
