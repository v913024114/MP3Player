----------

This version of Tritonus includes mp3 support.  This is due to
integration of javalayer 0.0.7, a pure-java mp3 decoder developed by
the javalayer project.  The big credit for this goes to Eric B. who
wrote the decoder.


The decoder is now fully integrated into Tritonus.

For a runnable program, see the file test/MpegPlayer.java.
